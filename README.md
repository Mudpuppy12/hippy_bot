# hippy_bot

A SlackBot for IOT devices. Named after my dalmatian dog 'Hippy' which I wrote this bot to monitor the temperature
in the dog kennel. Since I live in Texas a failure of the AC unit would be bad..


 Currently in development and will support:

*  ConnectSense devices 
*  Particle.IO devices
*  LIFX bulb

Command so far:

* 'dogtemp'
   Returns the current temperature in the Dog kennel along with humidity.
* 'chuck|norris
   Returns a chuck norris fact
